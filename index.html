		<h1>Justin's ePortfolio</h1>

		<p>Create a website that gives further insight into who I am as a person. Beyond the single piece of paper which aims to define our qualifications for a job. What kind of person am I? What have I made? Where do I put my time? What do I love to do? Once this site answers those questions through content and presentation, it is done.</p>
		<p>Teach Kids to Code (TKTC) - "Tick Tock" because it takes only a matter of time to learn something for <em>anybody</em>. Embrace the idea of the growth mindset and you're already there!</p>
		<p>Alternatively, TCKT (Teach Coding to Kids Today) - It's the golden ticket!</p>
